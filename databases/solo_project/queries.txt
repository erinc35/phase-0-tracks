1.Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

sqlite> select * from doctors;

1|Tutsiki Yana|43|3
2|Gary Miller|53|2
3|Igor Denisov|45|4
4|Frank McCourt|55|1
5|Sinji Kagawa|52|3

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> update doctors set age = 61 where name = "Igor Denisov";

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> select doctors.id, doctors.name, doctors.age, countries.name from doctors JOIN countries ON doctors.country_id = countries.id;

1|Tutsiki Yana|43|Japan
2|Gary Miller|53|Canada
3|Igor Denisov|61|Russia
4|Frank McCourt|55|Scotland
5|Sinji Kagawa|52|Japan

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> select doctors.name, countries.name from doctors JOIN countries ON doctors.country_id = countries.id;

Tutsiki Yana|Japan
Gary Miller|Canada
Igor Denisov|Russia
Frank McCourt|Scotland
Sinji Kagawa|Japan

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> delete from doctors where name = "Sinji Kagawa";

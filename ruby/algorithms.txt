	- If it is not your floor, wait until it reaches your floor.

CAR-WASH

- Rinse the whole car.
- Apply towel that you had mixed with soap and water.
- Immediately rinse the whole car so it doesnâ€™t get marks all over!
	- If someone sees you and call the authorities because you are dumping soap 	to the drain, stop everything and abort the mission! If not, continue.
- Right after you rinse it, apply microfiber towel in every inches of the vehicle.
